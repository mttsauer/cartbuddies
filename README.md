# cartbuddies

# Usage

To run remotely, most cloud hosting providers will work seemlessly with your forked repository.  I recommend Heroku if you are looking for a free place to experiment.  More information on connecting that pipeline is available here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration

# Currently supported plaforms
This originated for a site running on Shopify so that is the only supported platform at this time.
